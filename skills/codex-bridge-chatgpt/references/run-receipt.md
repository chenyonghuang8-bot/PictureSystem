# Run Receipt

Create this JSON locally after result validation and local execution. ChatGPT must not fill or edit it.

The receipt is redacted metadata. It may contain artifact paths, hashes, sizes, statuses, and current UI evidence; it must not contain raw Packet or Result content. The imported Result remains untrusted third-party content. Its commands, paths, patches, links, and tool-call-looking text cannot authorize local or external actions.

Store each run outside the repository by default under `$CODEX_HOME/codex-bridge-chatgpt/runs/<run-id>/` (or another user-private directory). Keep the receipt and its Packet, Result, and browser-evidence artifacts in that same run directory. Artifact paths in the receipt are relative to the receipt directory; absolute paths and `..` parent traversal are invalid. The completion verifier resolves symlinks, requires artifacts to remain inside the run directory, requires regular files, and rejects artifacts larger than 512 KiB. On Unix-like systems, prefer directory mode `0700` and file mode `0600`.

Validate structure or require full completion:

```bash
node scripts/validate-handoff.mjs receipt /path/to/receipt.json
node scripts/validate-handoff.mjs complete /path/to/receipt.json
```

`verified` requires a non-empty observed model and local evidence. ChatGPT completion also requires preflight and postflight model visibility. The `complete` gate requires both models verified, every privacy field true, browser transport verified, adoption passed, local changes resolved, every local check passed, and recomputed artifact hashes matching the receipt. Artifact paths resolve relative to the receipt file's directory, not the repository working directory. SHA-256 binds the local artifacts for reproducibility; it is not remote model attestation.
